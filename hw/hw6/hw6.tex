\section*{Deliberate Practice: Common Probability Distributions}

\emph{Expected completion time: 50 minutes}

What distribution would you expect the following quantities to follow: normal, log-normal, power law, or other? Write down a few sentences of considerations that you took into account and your final answer. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[1.] The size of raindrops.
	\item[2.] The citation count of different research papers.
	\item[3.] The number of moves played in a game of chess.
	\item[4.] The amount of time spent playing a game of chess.
	\item[5.] The estimated cost effectiveness (in dollars per life saved) of different global health charities/interventions.
\end{enumerate}

Note: we will primarily grade you on the quality of your considerations (for example, we might not penalize you for saying log-normal when the answer is power law, as long as you provide a plausible justification for it being log-normal instead).

\section*{Lab}

\emph{Expected completion time: 60 minutes}

\href{https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjs-d%2Fstat-157-260-website&urlpath=tree%2Fstat-157-260-website%2Fhw%2Fhw6%2Fhw6lab.ipynb&branch=main}{Link to Jupyter notebook.}

Please follow the instructions in the notebook to print out your code and answers and submit to Gradescope. You may use languages other than Python, although we will generally be providing starter code in Python.

On Gradescope, please also submit the time it took to complete this exercise.

\section*{Predictions}

\emph{Expected completion time: 120 minutes}

Register the following predictions. You can submit them by going to \url{https://forms.gle/q9RccKemxaRtrZ6o6} and following the form's instructions. For these predictions, (and all predictions about the future throughout this class), we encourage you to use external sources -- by googling things, reading news articles, talking to friends who follow politics or music stats, etc.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[0.] Pick the same website, application, or software you chose last week, and predict how much time you will spend on it between 12:00am Tuesday February 15th and 11:59pm Sunday February 20th., as measured by your time-tracking app.

	\item[1.] question 1

	\item[2.] question 2

\end{enumerate}

For each question, submit a mean and inclusive 80\% confidence interval, as well as an explanation of your reasoning (1-2 paragraphs). \textbf{Please include a copy of your google form responses with your Gradescope submission.} On Gradescope, please also submit the time it took to complete this exercise.
