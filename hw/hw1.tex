\emph{Expected completion time: 80 minutes}

Go to \url{https://www.openphilanthropy.org/calibration} and sign in (either create an account or use your 
Gmail / Facebook account). Click ``Home'' and complete the following exercises in the app:

\begin{itemize}

\item Confidence intervals (level 80\%) -- at least 30 questions
\item 30 questions each from two of the other categories (i.e., two out of PolitiFact, Correlations, City Populations, Math, and Trivia).

\end{itemize}

(Of course, feel free to answer more questions if you would like!)

At the end, go to the ``Results'' tab and take screenshots showing that 
you completed at least 30 questions in each category, as well as your calibration 
performance (the chart that appears below the results).
