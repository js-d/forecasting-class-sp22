\section*{Logistics Setup}

\emph{Expected completion time: 12 minutes}

Install a time-tracking app as described in the ``Predictions'' section, and submit a screenshot or photo showing it has been 
installed.

(TODO: JS denain add instructions on how to get an account on the streamlit app)


\section*{Deliberate Practice}

\emph{Expected completion time: 80 minutes}

Go to \url{https://www.openphilanthropy.org/calibration} and sign in (either create an account or use your 
Gmail / Facebook account). Click ``Home'' and complete the following exercises in the app:

\begin{itemize}

\item Confidence intervals (level 80\%) -- at least 30 questions
\item 30 questions each from two of the other categories (i.e., two out of PolitiFact, Correlations, City Populations, Math, and Trivia).

\end{itemize}

(Of course, feel free to answer more questions if you would like!)

At the end, go to the ``Results'' tab and take screenshots showing that 
you completed at least 30 questions in each category, as well as your calibration 
performance (the chart that appears below the results).

\section*{Predictions}

\emph{Expected completion time: 25 minutes}

Register the following predictions (TODO: JS Denain update with more specific instructions)

\begin{itemize}
\item Pick a website, application, or software of your choice. Predict how much time you will spend on it between 12:00am Tuesday January 25th and 11:59pm Sunday January 30th. You should track this {\bf using a time-tracking app} such as \href{https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210387}{Screen Time} (if you have macOS Catalina or later), \href{https://www.rescuetime.com/}{Rescue Time}, Digital Wellbeing (Android), or any another tracker you prefer.\footnote{Note that some desktop apps record screen time even when an app is open in the background; you might want to be careful about this when making predictions or choosing the application.}

\item Predict how many people will be in the Zoom lecture at 11:15am on Wednesday, January 26th.

      This will resolve based on a count conducted by the course staff.

\item Which motion picture will have the maximum domestic gross on the weekend of Jan 28-30?

      This will resolve according to \href{https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/?ref_=bo_nb_wey_secondarytab}{Box Office Mojo}.

\end{itemize}

For each question, submit a mean, 80\% confidence interval, and an explanation of your reasoning (~1-2 paragraphs).
For the last two questions, your prediction (but not the explanation) will appear on the public leaderboard. 
The first question will remain private to you and not count towards the leaderboard.
