\section*{Deliberate Practice: Calibration}

\emph{Expected completion time: 30 minutes}

Go to \url{https://www.openphilanthropy.org/calibration} and complete 30 questions under the Confidence Intervals (level 60\%) category.

At the end, go to the ``Results'' tab and take screenshots showing that 
you completed at least 30 questions and your calibration 
performance (the chart that appears below the results).

\section*{Deliberate Practice: Estimation}

\emph{Expected completion time: 70 minutes}

For each of the following questions, estimate the answer without looking things up (try to think for at least 2-3 minutes), then look up the answer and calculate the relative error of your estimate.  (it's often hard to get one definitive answer, so we just picked something that seems reasonable for each one. You will be graded for your thinking process, not for accuracy) 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many cattle are in the world in 2021? 
	\item What's the length of the SF Bay Bridge, in meters? 
	\item How heavy, in tons, is the Titanic? 
	\item How many paid subscribers of Netflix are there as of Q3 of 2021?
	\item How many statistics and biostatistics degrees (Bachelors plus Masters plus PhD) were given in U.S. in 2020? 
	\item What's the GDP of Mexico 2020? 
	\item How many musicians are employed in the U.S.?
	\item What's the depth of the deepest hole, in meters, humans have dug? 
\end{enumerate}


Here is our set of links that contain answers:

\item \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole}
\end{enumerate}

Also, devise two estimation questions of your own, for quantities you are interested in. Again, estimate the answer without looking things up, then look up a reasonable answer and compute your relative error.

On Gradescope, for each of the \textbf{10 questions (8 provided plus 2 created by you)}, submit your estimate, an explanation of your estimate, and your relative error.

\section*{Predictions}

\emph{Expected completion time: 35 minutes}

Register the following predictions (TODO: JS Denain update with google form)



For each question, submit a mean, 80\% confidence interval, and an explanation of your reasoning (~1-2 paragraphs).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item TODO
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Lab}
